has the question with the sign " " "
such as :cat "envx.h"|grep class
        :cat envx.h | grep class|grep "envx"         is wrong.
but     :cat envx.h | grep "class"|grep envx         is right.

e.g:
/home/hdt/fshell/ashell/src#cat pipex.cpp| grep "m"|grep "b"
用法: grep [选项]... PATTERN [FILE]...
试用‘grep --help’来获得更多信息。
