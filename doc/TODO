:2.Deal with the directory stuff:
         for example,if he(the user) inputed "./something"
         we should search it in the *CURRENT* PATH
         or he just typed something like dir1/dir2/something,we should just execute the file in the /bin/ 
            *AND* in the CURRENT directory
         or something like "/dir1/dir2/something",we should execute from the root.
         And because some reasons,we can do some optimlizations to the code frame.We can put the ./something
          and /dir1/dir2/something situations into one(if using execve())
